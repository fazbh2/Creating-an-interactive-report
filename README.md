Creating an Interactive Report

An interactive report allows users to explore data dynamically, uncover insights, and make informed decisions by interacting directly with visuals and filters rather than viewing static information.

🔹 Key Components of an Interactive Report

Slicers & Filters: Enable users to filter data by date, category, region, or other dimensions
